General aspects
===========================

* Research is only a minor aspect of the game
* Techs can be researched by investing money, the research of a tech takes 4 turns to complete
* All Techs require the current date to have passed a certain year and can require the research of some precursor techs
* After the starting year of the tech, the cost get exponentially cheaper with a half time of 20 years
* At most 2 tech projects at the same time, unless the College is upgraded to a University (then 4 tech projects at
  the same time).
* Techs are not tradable, there are additional discounts (~20% if all players have the Tech already)
* Exploring the country for minerals is also a research project â€“ it will reveal some random resources. Can only be
  researched if there are resources to be discovered left. The resource to be discovered will not change upon reload.
* Different categories: Military (M), Economical (E), Diplomatic (D), Naval (N), Land units (L), Resources non-food
  (R), Food (F). Each category gives a symbol on the Tech sheet and can be used to sort the table of available Techs.

.. todo:: Random resources must be balanced somehow and must be preserved upon reloads
